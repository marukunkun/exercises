// Working with variables
    // Declare two variables: admin and name.
    // Assign the value "John" to name.
    // Copy the value from name to admin.
    // Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).

let admin
let name

name = "John"
admin = name

alert( admin )


// Giving the right name
    // Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?

let ourPlanetName = 'earth'

    // Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?

let currentUserName = 'maru'


// Uppercase const ?
    // Examine the following code:

const birthday = '18.04.1982';
const age = someCode(birthday);

    // Here we have a constant birthday for the date, and also the age constant.
    // Would it be right to use upper case for birthday? For age? Or even for both?

const BIRTHDAY = '18.04.1982'; // make birthday uppercase ? YES
const AGE = someCode(BIRTHDAY); // make age uppercase ? NO
